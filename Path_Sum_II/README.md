# Path Sum II

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals targetSum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22

Output: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]

Example 2:

<img src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg">

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5

Output: []

Example 3:

Input: root = [1,2], targetSum = 0

Output: []
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].

-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
